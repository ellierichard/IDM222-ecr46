While reading The Politics of Design by Ruben Pater, I was exposed to colors's 
different meanings, uses, the history of them, the present standings on them, and more. 
This reading mainly made points about how humans use colors and what those colors mean.
Beginning with Issac Newton's triangular prism, proving all colors come from light, 
the reading moves into each color's meaning and how it differs by country. It then moves 
onto the topics of gender and race and the affiliation color has with them. It then moves
on to how humans began sampling colors with “shirley cards” and more. Overall this 
reading explains the political choices humans have made with color that sometimes result
in a visual miscommunication. I thought this reading really showed how much of an 
impact visual communication has, and how it goes without notice easily. I found the 
blurb about “Drop Food, Not Bombs” was really eye-opening because a color mistake, or 
visual miscommunication, caused severe threats to people's lives. This paper made me 
think about how color has its own language in a way, this leads me to questions regarding 
color-blind people. The reading explains how color-blindness occurs in the eye, but I was 
left wondering and wanting to know more about the specific politics regarding color-blind 
people and the different visual communications they'd have and interpret. I think an 
important insight was the visual communications between race and color. I thought there 
were very key insights on the color-it-in page and the History of Color In Black 
and White. These readings clarified the visual communication we have with race and 
color, since the beginning of slavery, white has been generalized with good and pure, 
while black is degraded to dirty and low. This is shown through many different things 
all within the reading. Overall, I think this reading expanded the way I now think, 
interpret, and look at colors.
