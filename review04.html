        The Uncovered Story of the Woman Behind HeLa
        Henrietta Lacks’s name became known from her cancer cells that grew the first immortalized cell line known today as HeLa cells. No one knew the story of the woman behind the cells because of her skin color. As an African American woman with cervical cancer, doctors from Johns Hopkins took advantage of her race and condition by taking a biopsy without her knowledge or consent in effort to grow immortal cells. Rebecca Skloot, a journalist and scientist wanted to know and reveal the story that came with these cells starting with the life of Henrietta which led to the making of the book, The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks. Rebecca Skloot’s unbiased personality let her immerse herself with the Lacks family in order to achieve her goal of revealing Henrietta Lacks and her family's life story. Rebecca faced challenges in her journalistic process due to racial concerns, but with patience she was eventually able to gain the trust of the Lacks family, allowing her to record their lives both before and after HeLa.

        Helen Lane, Henrietta Lakes, Helen Larson, and HeLa were all names that were used when speaking about Henrietta. Henrietta Lacks was her real name which not many people thought to seek out and those that did were stopped by Johns Hopkins, but not Rebecca Skloot. Skloot wanted to know the real name and the life that came with it. Previous to getting in contact with the Lacks family Skloot had done extensive research in an attempt to understand the concern that comes with African Americans and science. When talking to her only contact that could connect her with the Lackses she proved her understanding by talking about the Tuskegee syphilis study like she “was giving an oral report in history class”(50). Skloot covered all topics from how the doctors “watched them die slow, painful, and preventable deaths”(50) to how the patients were taken advantage of because “they were poor and uneducated.”(50) and believed to be “a notoriously syphilis soaked race.”(50) Skloot acknowledges the extreme racism that many black people faced, this acknowledgment eventually gets her Deborah Lacks’s phone number, Deborah was the youngest of the Lackses and Henrietta had died not long after giving birth to her.
        During their first phone call, Deborah had been excited when Skloot said she wanted to write a book about her mother because in the past people had only called Deborah to learn about the cells, not the name or person that came with them. She was quick to mention her distrust when it comes to her mother’s cells. When rambling to Skloot she mentioned “I didn’t think it was fit for him to steal my mother medical record and autopsy papers”(52) before stating how she “can’t take it anymore” because “who are we supposed to trust now?”(53). Deborah didn’t give much context during their first phone call leaving Skloot with scribbled and confused notes. Skloot realized Deborah would be her main source of information because she was so willing to chatter about her family but then stumbled during the second phone call when Deborah said she couldn’t talk to Skloot anymore. This lead Skloot to calling Day, Henrietta’s husband who was in his 80’s, Skloot tried to explain what she wanted to do and why she was calling about Henrietta’s cells and Day replied, “Well, so let my old lady cells talk to you and leave me alone”(55). Although the family seemed uninterested, Skloot was persistent and eventually got Sonny Lacks, Henrietta’s son, to meet with her simply because Sonny was “worn out from my number showing up on his pager”(67). Sonny never showed up, Skloot later got him on the phone and he gave no reasoning for his decision not to meet. Sonny did however tell Skloot that if she wanted to get in touch with his family in Clover then she should go there and find them herself and that is exactly what she did. Skloot was struggling with the little information she gathered but she remained determined to gain the trust that the Lackses seemed uninterested in giving.

        The Lacks family ignored her, no one could be certain about her intentions since they had been burned before but Skloot put everything into her research and remained patient that someone would eventually open up to her. That someone eventually became Deborah, after waiting and being “checked out”(159) by Lawrence, the only brother who remembers Henrietta, Skloot slowly became allowed to talk to whomever was willing to speak with her. Deborah was the most thrilled about the making of the book because she wanted to learn more about her mother. Skloot began to work very closely with Deborah, being careful and patient to assure Deborah that her intentions were valid. Deborah made it clear that she wanted to be a part of the research process so Skloot complied with her wishes and “began sending her stacks of information I uncovered about her mother--scientific journal articles, photos of the cells” and “with each packet, I sent notes explaining what each thing meant, clearly labeling what was fiction and what wasn’t, and warning her about anything that might upset her”(252). Skloot did this to make Deborah happy and so she wouldn’t be left in the dark about anything.

        After some time of working with one another, Skloot and Deborah began working as a team unraveling Henrietta's life and learning as much as possible, but Deborah didn’t always make this process easy. When discovering things about Elsie, Deborah’s sister who died at 15 after being diagnosed with “idiocy”, Deborah would randomly “pound on my [Skloot’s] door”(279) because she had decided she wasn’t going to bed and simply said “let’s get busy”(279) so Skloot did just that and would get to work with Deborah because if Deborah wasn’t going to bed that meant neither was Skloot. Although Deborah and Skloot had been working closely together for a while, Deborah would get phases of distrust which tested Skloot’s patience. When taking a trip together “we always took two cars because Deborah didn’t trust me enough to ride with me yet”(253) but sometimes it would be more severe where Deborah would snap and out of the blue and panic asking things like “who you working for?”(283) or “who sent you?” and “who’s paying you?”(283) Skloot would frantically explain and try to calm Debroah reminding her that they wanted the same things. There would even be times where Deborah would stop communication with Skloot but these periods of time wouldn’t last long, they just occurred frequently. The longer and closer they worked together, the less these phases would happen and Deborah and Skloot became not only a team but somewhat friends as they laughed, elbowed, and consoled together.

        Deborah and Skloot spent many long nights and long hours together trying to learn Henrietta’s story. Aside from the occasional panic states of Deborah not knowing who to trust, Skloot and Deborah revealed a lot about all of the Lackses, completing both their goals of telling Henrietta’s story. Although it wasn’t always easy, Skloot managed to unravel a story that no one else had before and titled it The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks, sharing not only Henrietta’s story but her own and explaining the journey she had to take in order to get information. All of the research with Deborah made it possible for her to write about Henrietta's children and their story as well.
