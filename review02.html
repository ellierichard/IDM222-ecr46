        Steve Krug's Don't Make Me Think, Revisited: A Common Sense Approach to Web 
        Usability highlights everything a designer needs to know in order to build 
        great and usable websites. The mission of this book is to give such good insights
        that if you read it, you won't need to hire someone like Steve Krug because you
        can do it yourself. Specifically, Krug wrote the book for people who can't 
        afford to hire someone like him. The overall goal is to make the objectives 
        and goals of user experience easy to understand.

        Throughout the book, Steve Krug goes over four main topics crucial to the 
        understanding of good design for Usability on the web. The first, guiding 
        principles of web design. Don't make me think! The most important usability 
        law, creating something obvious and self explanatory to the point where the 
        user doesn't need to think about the design. When you accomplish this, you've 
        created a good design. “The point is that every question mark adds to our 
        cognitive workload, distracting our attention from the task at hand. The 
        distractions may be slight but they add up, especially if it's something we 
        do all the time like deciding what to click on.” (Krug 24) This quote highlights 
        how users question their moves on websites due to a poor design that forces the 
        user to think and question what certain features on a website do. Before teaching 
        how to build a good design, Krug goes over how users read websites. It's important 
        to understand what the user is looking at on a website, and what 
        they're paying attention to. This way, the designer can ensure what they 
        want to be seen, will be seen.

        The second main topic focused on designing navigation. Users need their eyes to be 
        directed through the web with clear pathways to take them where they want to go. 
        Without a sense of direction or location the user will feel lost in the website. 
        Krug thoroughly explains how you can achieve good navigation design. Navigation 
        reveals the important content within the website, good navigation will lead the 
        user right to what they want. Having a well designed homepage is critical, it 
        not only starts the user on a good note, but it also adds to good navigation 
        for the rest of the site. A good homepage has many needs to meet such as: 
        advertising deals, shortcuts, and registration. Homepages also need to be 
        able to show the user what they're looking for and not looking for, show 
        them where to start, and establish trust with the user.
    </p> 
    <p>  
        In order to ensure a design will work as intended, usability tests are performed. 
        The third main topic narrows down on making sure the reader understands the 
        previous two sections. Krug explains how usability testing establishes how 
        successful the initial design is. By testing, you gain the insights of your 
        target audience which clears any debates or worries about the website. 
        Testing will highlight the flaws as well as show what works.

        Finally, Krug finishes off by connecting all of the information and 
        explaining how it applies when it is finished and in the real world. 
        Krug explains how a website will never be perfect. As things change, 
        we need to adapt to those changes. This section showed how the outside 
        world affects website structure and design.
        
        Steve Krug's, Don't Make Me Think: Revisited, was written in a way where 
        any person could pick up this book and understand what is being talked 
        about. Every sentence where I had a question, it was answered in the next. 
        Krug presents the perfect amount of information, I never felt overwhelmed 
        reading, as well as I was never bored. The information was relevant and 
        felt useful. With every point Krug made, he verified it with picture proof. 
        Inserted throughout the entire book are pictures and captions and arrows 
        thoroughly explaining what I was supposed to be learning.
