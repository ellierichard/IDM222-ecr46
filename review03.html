        Analog In, Digital Out: Brendan Dawes on Interaction Design, shows how he changes his ways of thinking about products and interfaces and how he applies creativity and uniqueness to interaction design. He took interaction design and explained his thought process on his creations in a fun and enjoyable way because interaction design is fun and enjoyable. I found this book extremely interesting for that reason, there was so much excitement with every project explained in the book, giving me excitement about reading it. Brendan Dawes made every section interesting, one that really resonated with me was section 3. Brown Paper and String Moments. This section was talking about our crave as humans for experiences as Dawes says, “The experience of an object, the little special details, which makes us want to interact with it in some way, physically or emotionally.” He then goes on to give an example where he compares the experience he had with an expensive, nicely packaged cheese to one he would have with a generic, low effort appearance cheese. Even though the cheeses tasted nearly the same, the more admirable cheese will win because you’re paying for the experience. We constantly pay for experiences because once again Dawes says, “We’re humans, full of flaws, we’re not machines that make decisions based simply on efficiency.” The way Dawes shows his thoughts in his reading makes it extremely enjoyable to read, all the explanations are laid out making his writing very clear. I thought the way the watch, cheese, and bag were all completely different examples but connected perfectly and made sense

        This book connects to my degree, UX/ID or, User Experience and Interaction Design. Brendan Dawes dives into everything related to interaction design, different ways to think about design, different interface options, how to get creative about your design, and so many more. My degree will teach me how to create interaction design while applying user experience knowledge, this book perfectly covers those topics. Using the psychology of humans to better understand the user experience, Dawes then takes that and applies it when creating a new product or design relating to interaction design.

        The findings and notes taken on this book will be a great help for the rest of my career at Drexel University. With multiple insights to be taken away with every section of reading, I plan on taking those insights and lessons and applying them to my studies. The very first lesson learned was to look up, don’t get distracted trying to get from point A to B as fast as possible, if you do this the world will become invisible as you miss what’s going on around you. I plan on doing this every day, I want to walk around and look up and around to “open my mind to the world of input that constantly surrounds us.” New things are always ready to be found; you just have to look for them. This book taught me: that I can break down big problems to make them simpler, not to wonder if my idea is even possible and instead just start working at it, to think outside the box, and lots more that I plan to use going forward.
