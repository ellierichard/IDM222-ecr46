                User Experience and Interaction Design(UXID) combines principles to form a creative, versatile, and interdisciplinary skillset. Todays world of tecnology is everchanging and more demanding, with UXID, I'm more prepared for these demanding needs by gaining exposure to: User Experience Design, User Interface design, Information Architecture, Web Development, and Project Management. My freshman year focused on the basics of design using Adobe Creative Cloud as well as old school pencil and paper. My sophomore year focused on the development of those designs using Visual Studio Code to learn how to bring my creations to life. My junior and senior studies will consist of diving into electives and creating projects that cater to my passions.
